# Hatel Layout
The Hatel layout is a keyboard layout that maps keys on a piano to keys on a
computer keyboard.

## Current Progress
Currently, I only have all 26 Latin letters, space, and backspace mapped and
finalized.

Here is the specification so far:
| Piano Chord | Latin Letter  |
| :-:         | :-:           |
| C           | e             |
| D           | t             |
| E           | a             |
| F           | h             |
| G           | j             |
| A           | k             |
